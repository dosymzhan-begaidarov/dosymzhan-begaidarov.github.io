          <h2>Childhood</h2>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, I was born and raised in Zhitikara, a small town in the Northern part of Kazakhstan. Growing up, I was always interested in art and design, and spent most of my free time drawing and sketching. It wasn't until later in life that I realized I could turn my passion into a career.</p>
