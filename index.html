            <h3>History</h3>
                <p>On the coast of the Shortanda River in the Kostanay region of Kazakhstan lies the city of Zhitikara,
                    which borders Russia. This is a small industrial town that exists due to the extraction of asbestos from canyons. 
                    The prehistory of the modern city begins with the Kazakh aul Konildi, which was founded around 1880.</p>
